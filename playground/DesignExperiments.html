	<h2><a href="https://philhosoft.github.io/playground/JapaneseKanjiLearning.html">Japanese Kanji Learning</a></h2>
	<p>This is a mockup of a page showing a Japanese Kanji character (ideogram of Chinese origin)
	with its readings (ON = pronunciation of Chinese origin, mostly used in word compounds,
	KUN = pronunciation of Japanese origin, mostly used in word declinations) and English meaning,
	the main components of the character, and some additional information and links.
	</p>
	<p>This is mostly to demonstrate I can design a page and implement a design.<br>
	It is a kind of work in progress, this one has been made quite quickly (half a day) and could use some more work.<br>
	In particular, I have to work on the responsive design, changing the layout for smaller screens.
